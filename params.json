{"name":"Log4jtoXml","tagline":"Project for PB138","body":"# **Welcome to Log4jToXml project page**\r\nThe main purpose of this page is to inform you about the project for subject PB138 - Modern markup languages and their application, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, spring 2015.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## The aim of the project\r\nThe main aim of this project is to create a fully functional executable java application which will be used as a converter for the [log4j configuration](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/). The application will be able to convert the log4j configuration between two formats commonly used for storing log4j - properties and XML, both ways. The final application will be executable from the command line and from the Java code (probably jar executable). The final project should have an user friendly GUI before it will be published.\r\n\r\n## Basic project schema\r\nThe project consists of four main parts, each one is managed by one person. The back end is handled by **Frederik Hudák** ( log4j.properties --> XML ) and **Martin Štefanko** (XML --> log4j.properties). The front end (GUI and executable application) is managed mainly by **Lukáš Linhart**, with help of **David Kratochvíl**, who is mainly responsible for the application testing.\r\n\r\n## Current status\r\nCurrently, the project is in development stage.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n### Project working group:\r\n* Lukáš Linhart (@Linhos13)\r\n* David Kratochvíl (@Kratocdav)\r\n* Frederik Hudák (@FreHu)\r\n* Martin Štefanko (@xstefank)\r\n\r\n### Project advisors:\r\n* RNDr. Filip Nguyen\r\n* doc.
